## Description

You have a 1-indexed binary string of length n where all the bits are 0 initially. We will flip all the bits of this binary string (i.e., change them from 0 to 1) one by one. You are given a 1-indexed integer array flips where flips[i] indicates that the bit at index i will be flipped in the ith step.

A binary string is prefix-aligned if, after the ith step, all the bits in the inclusive range [1, i] are ones and all the other bits are zeros.

Return the number of times the binary string is prefix-aligned during the flipping process.

## Solution Main Idea

right is the number of the right most lighted bulb.

Iterate the input light A,
update right = max(right, A[i]).

Now we have lighted up i + 1 bulbs,
if right == i + 1,
it means that all the previous bulbs (to the left) are turned on too.
Then we increment res
